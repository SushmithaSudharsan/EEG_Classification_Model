# EEG Signal Analysis and Classification  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project focuses on the analysis and classification of EEG signals to distinguish between different brain states (e.g., normal vs. abnormal). By utilizing preprocessing techniques, signal visualization, and machine learning models (1D CNN and LSTM), the goal is to identify patterns and anomalies in EEG data for effective classification and diagnosis.
